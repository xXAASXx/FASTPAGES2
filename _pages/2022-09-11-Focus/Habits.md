# Focus/Habits

My Goals:

- Become an entranprenour

- Live in a big house

- Drive a fancy car

- Use coding in my everyday life to make new things

- With my dad being a software engineer I do not want to be the same as him but I hope to do something better in the future. 


Yale Video:
- Some key details from the Yale video are the amazing life lessons and reality of college students the lady was providing us. Many of those same aspects she talks about in the video are be important for people to understand. Often times even as a Del Norte student people are overwhelmed with stress due to the amount of AP classes and other stressfull issues. Mental health should always be a focus no matter what major and I love how Mr. Mortensen showed this video to the class because it really helped touch up on what is going on around the world of education where people tend not to talk about it. 

Appreciate This:
- Having a family
- Food on the table
- Having a home
- Meeting new people
- Helping others with mental health
- Being nice to those around me
- Be thankful of all the little things
